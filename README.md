# IntoToGit

Once you check out this repository, I want you to create a file in the "IntroToGit" folder, that is named with your name and ends with a .md

That file, just like this one will be in the markdown format.  You can enter plain text, but you can also format things with the characters you type in.  You are not required to know or use markdown, but you may find it useful during this course.
A page with a lot of [examples of markdown formatting](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
